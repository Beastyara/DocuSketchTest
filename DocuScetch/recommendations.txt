I have python file that is called draw_plots

It has only one function called draw_plots. 

When we import that python file 
and call that function in Jupiter Notebook 
then it will draw plots to visually check the relations 
between all pairs of numerical columns. 

I accurately show all steps of my work with this test task
You can check the comments in python file as well as in jupiter file 

Thank you for your attention
